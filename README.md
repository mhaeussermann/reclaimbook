# reclaimbook
Just a quick little web app to create Reclam-like book covers using HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Layout heavily inspired by https://thepablo.life. Done as a project to learn more about Javascript and HTML5 and to present text generated by a neural network in an interactive and fun way.

# Features
* Pushing the *Vorschlag*-Button adds a random entry out of a list of around 1650 titles which were generated using textgenrnn by @minimaxir.
* Pushing the *Download*-Button downloads the cover as 'mein-buchcover.png'.

# Problems
* Right now, there is a limit of 21 characters for the title because line-breaks are not yet implemented.
